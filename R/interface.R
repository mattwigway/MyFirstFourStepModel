# This file contains the notebook interface to the four step model
# True to form, there are four functions here to use in the notebook, which correspond
# to the four steps.
#
#  - trip_generation
#  - trip_distribution
#  - mode_choice
#  - network_assignment
#
# The model object is a named list that contains the following:
#   production_functions - trip production models
#   attraction_function - trip attraction models
#   distribution_betas - list containing gravity model betas for HBO, HBW, and NHB
#   mode_choice_models - list containing mode choice models for HB and NHB
#   direction_factors - tibble with "direction factors" -
#      how many trips in each direction to expect at different time period for HB trips
#   occupancy_factors - tibble with average vehicle occupancy for car trips by time period and
#       trip type
#   network - an igraph graph object representing the road network
#   network_geo - an sf object representing the road network (for plotting)
#   tazs_geo - an sf object with all TAZs (tracts)
#   scenarios - any scenarios that are shipped with the model (by default, only the baseline
#     that the model was estimated with, but more can be added before calling save_model if desired).
# 
# There is additionally a function estimate(), which will create the model object
